# TechFreedom

**A clearer forecast for your organisation's digital future.**

TechFreedom helps organisations understand their technology dependencies and start making deliberate choices about them.

## About

Most organisations don't choose their technology stack; they inherit it. Over time, a tangle of SaaS subscriptions, cloud services, and platform dependencies builds up, often without anyone noticing the risks.

TechFreedom is a cohort-based programme built around three pillars:

- **Jurisdiction**: Where does your data actually live, and under whose laws?
- **Business Continuity**: What happens when a platform changes the rules?
- **Surveillance**: How much does your tech stack know about you?

## Pages

- `/` Landing page
- `/manifesto/` Principles
- `/programme/` Programme details (sessions, pricing, FAQ)
- `/alternatives/` Alternatives assessment tool (coming soon)
- `/assess/` Self-assessment

## Tech

No build step, no framework. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

- **Typography**: Fraunces + DM Sans via [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net) (privacy-friendly)
- **Animations**: CSS keyframes + Intersection Observer
- **Forms**: Netlify Forms with honeypot spam protection
- **Hosting**: Netlify (auto-deploys from `main`)
