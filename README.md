# TechFreedom

**See your technology clearly.**

TechFreedom helps organisations in the voluntary, community, and social enterprise (VCSE) sector understand their technology dependencies — and start making informed choices about them.

## About

Most organisations don't choose their technology stack — they inherit it. Over time, a tangle of SaaS subscriptions, cloud services, and platform dependencies builds up, often without anyone noticing the risks.

TechFreedom is a structured programme covering three pillars:

- **Jurisdiction** — Where does your data actually live, and under whose laws?
- **Business Continuity** — What happens when a platform changes the rules?
- **Surveillance** — How much does your tech stack know about you?

## Tech

Single-page landing site. No build step, no framework — just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

- **Typography**: Fraunces + DM Sans (Google Fonts)
- **Animations**: CSS keyframes + Intersection Observer
- **Forms**: Netlify Forms
- **Hosting**: Netlify (auto-deploys from `main`)

## Deploy

Pushes to `main` auto-deploy via Netlify. For local preview:

```bash
npx serve .
```
